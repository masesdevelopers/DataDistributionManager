# Data Distribution Manager

A reliable subsystem able to distribute data across multiple datacenters using multiple technologies.
It is the core of [Sinapse](https://www.sinapsesystem.com) High Avalailablity, now we made it available for everyone.

Current implementation can use [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) or [OpenDDS](https://opendds.org/) as back-end.
