# Sinapse platform: the definitive solution for Agile development

We use **Data Distribution Manager** as the core of [Sinapse](https://www.sinapsesystem.com) High Avalailablity.
Sinapse is able to distribute, across multiple servers, workflows execution, balance load conditions and can recover from servers failure using a distributed system based on Data Distribution Manager.

A simple overview, from our presentations, is as the following one:

To be interoperable Sinapse front-end is based on [OPC-UA](https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/) protocol, the backend is based on a specific version of **Data Distribution Manager**.

## Messages as the glue

Sinapse platform is genral purpose module based platform: modules communication is based on serializable structured messages. 
All Sinapse modules are insulated and doesn't know anthing about other modules, there is a loosely-coupled linkage between them: modules use serializable messages to exchange information between them. During run-time, Sinapse core make aware a module about the message.
These messages are exchanged from the modules of Sinapse platform using the reliable common bus.

An overview of a single message is as the following figure:

## Dynamic processor

The messages are processed using a multi-level, multiple language configurable engine:

![Module engine](../images/module_engine.png?raw=true "Module engine")

The engine receives in input the message, analyze it and output one, or more resulting messages. The engine hosts a scriptable engine and scripts can be updated at run-time.

## Standalone versus multi-server

The messages to, and from, modules are exchanged using the multi-server message bus and disptached to all Sinapse servers involved in the configuration.
In a sandalone condition, oly one server is in execution and dos not need the full bus features, while in other conditions the multi-server bus is mandatory.

### Standalone

Below two figures which describes the above sentence within a production plant.Starting, in a simple scenario, with a single Sinapse server:

### Fault tolerance/Load balancing

It is possible to add High Availability adding more servers in the configuration:

![Fault tolerance/Load balancing](../images/sinapse_ft_lb.png?raw=true "Fault tolerance/Load balancing")

The above servers communicates each other over a specific version of **Data Distribution Manager**.

## Workflows

Below an explanation of what happens when multiple servers are involved in a workflows.
All workflows in the figures can be spawned across balanced servers for High Availability.

### Single server workflow

Starting from a single server, the following figure shows a simple workflow which link a PLC to a database:

![Simple workflow](../images/sinapse_workflow.png?raw=true "Simple workflow")

### Multiple servers workflow

Starting from the previous workflow, if each server executes its own workflow, they can be chained along multiple servers creating a multiple-server workflow:
